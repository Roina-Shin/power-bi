## Create a measure table

- First click on Enter Data and simply click load. Or, enter the following to create an empty table:


```
Measure Table = {""}
```

- If you created a blank table, it's just a placeholder for now. Head back to the report view.

- Create a new measure inside the table you just created.


![new_measure](/DAX_pictures/new_measure.png "new measure")


- Delete the placeholder column that was originally created when we created the measure table. Then, it becomes a dedicated measure table.
